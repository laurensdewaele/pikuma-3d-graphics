Was super frustrated that CLION cannot recognize SDL3, or any easy settings to tell where it can find it...
Also pretty annoying that Gustavo doesn't mention anything about this, whilst he probably has some
complex vim setup...


Anyways...

General outline:

setup()

while (TRUE) {
    process_input()
    update()
    render()
}
