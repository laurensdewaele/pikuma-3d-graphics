This was pretty interesting.

To achieve a perspective projection,
We need a camera point,
and we need the frustrum.
And to implement, implementing the perspective divide,
seems to be enough.


Still seems a bit weird.
We're generating a cube, -1 to 1,
and projecting the points (given our 'eye' is 1 away from the display),
and when rendering the points, we're displacing them so they appear in the middle of the screen,
and we're making them 4x4 rects
