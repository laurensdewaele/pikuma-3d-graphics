[] Get the window working.

Something goes wrong when trying to create a renderer with SDL.
How can I debug this?
Find out what's happenning?

SDL_Init failed: Couldn't find matching render driver

I guess it finds SDL3 correctly, otherwise I woudln't be able to create a window,
but now it's having trouble establishing a renderer.
Maybe set it to software for now?

-> Switch to the stable SDL2 version for now.

Ah, that's why I switched to SDL3:
"This header is only meant to be used on x86 and x64 architecture"


Specifing the lib and include headers make it work.
I now have a working window.

Now I would really like CLION to have SDL2 stuff...

Ok... it seems like that requires CMake,
and that divergence would take me too long.

SDL2 is only required for window creation, so let's move on without.

I also don't know why CLion isn't recognizing the structure...
